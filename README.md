# Neural_Networks_3
In this repository are three neural networks, the purpose of which is to demonstrate and teach the levels of complexity and operation of this technology. The first is a 2-layer network capable of solving only linear-type problems. The second one ('Resoluci√≥_Problema') is a neural network with a more complex multilayered architecture, where the activation functions are present and able to solve non-linear problems. 
Finally, the third is a convolutional neural network that receives external video inputs and in-real-time, specialized in facial detection and identification.
