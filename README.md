# Neural_Networks_3
In this repository are three neural networks, the purpose of which is to demonstrate and teach the levels of complexity and operation of this technology. The first ('Red simple') is a 2-layer network capable of solving only linear-type problems. The second one ('Resolució_Problema') is a neural network with a more complex multilayered architecture, where the activation functions are present and able to solve non-linear problems. 
Finally, the third, is a convolutional neural network that receives external video inputs and in-real-time, specialized in facial detection and identification. (inside the folder named 'Pràctica' are the three archives related to the three main steps of the CNN)
